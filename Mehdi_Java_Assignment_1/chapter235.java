/*
*2.35 (Car-Pool Savings Calculator) Research several car-pooling websites. 
*Create an application that calculates your daily driving cost, so that you 
*can estimate how much money could be saved by car pooling, which also has
*other advantages such as reducing carbon emissions and reducing traffic congestion.
*The application should input the following information and display 
 the userâ€™s cost per day of driving to work:

*Total miles driven per day.
*Cost per gallon of gasoline.
*Average miles per gallon.
*Parking fees per day.
*Tolls per day.
